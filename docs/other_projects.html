<p class=intro>If you can't get enough, or landed here by accident and find that keyboards do nothing for you, you might find some of <a href="https://twitter.com/mkrzywinski">my opinions good starters for conversation</a>. Alternatively, why not dig through my repository of web pages <a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca">mkweb.bcgsc.ca</a>. 

<h2>port knocking</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.portknocking.org">www.portknocking.org</a>

<p>My claim to fame, or at least exposure, in the computer security
world is port knocking, which is a method of network authentication
across closed ports. Specifically, using port knocking a client can
effectively communicate a request to a server, which has no open
ports. Typically, this is a request for the server to open a port to
the client.

<p>The motivation behind this security method was to mitigate the
dangers of keeping ports open for network services that are used
either infrequently, by few users, or both. 

<p>The method is in principle very simple (it can be coded in simple
bash) and has caught the imagination of many developers and users. It
was published in June 2003 issue of Sys Admin (<a href="http://www.portknocking.org/docs/krzywinski-portknocking-sysadmin2003.pdf">download PDF</a>)
and Linux Journal. The port knocking Linux
Journal article is one of the <a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/top-25-linuxjournalcom-articles-all-time-part-1">top
25 Linux Journal articles of all time</a>.

<h2>Circos</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.circos.ca">www.circos.ca</a>

<p>My other claim to fame, or at least something round, is
Circos. It's data visualization software used to generate visualize
comparisons between genomes. Its distinguishing feature is the
circular composition of the ideograms, which resolves many of the
problems encountered when these kind of data are drawn with a linear
layout.

<p>I wrote Circos to be automatable and flexible and, to my knowledge,
it is the most adaptable circular visualization tool currently
available. My <a href="http://www.circos.ca/images">Circos images</a> have appeared in the New York Times on
several occassions (<a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/11/11/science/20081111_EPIGENETICS_GRAPHIC.html">visualizing
epigenomics</a>, <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/01/22/science/20070123_SCI_ILLO.html">visualizing
genome comparisons</a>, <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/12/15/us/politics/DEBATE.html">visualizing
political debates</a>), and in other publications such as Conde Nast
and Geo, and on the cover of books and magazines, as well as installations at the <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/02/20/beautiful-science-picturing-data-inspiring-insight-at-the-british-library">British Library Beautiful Science exhibit</a> and <a href="http://unlockinglifescode.org/">Smithsonian's Genome Zone exhibit</a>.

<p>I have introduced a <a
href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/tableviewer"> way to to visualize tables</a> in Circos. This approach visually represents
all the data in a table and makes readily apparent complex patterns in
the data that are normally opaque to inspection of the table.

<p>Circos grew out of the <a
href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/schemaball">Schemaball</a> project,
which used circular composition to visualize database schemas.

<h2>lexical analysis of presidential debates</h2>

<p><a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/debates2012">mkweb.bcgsc.ca/debates2012</a>

<p>When Obama and McCain were debating in late 2008, I wondered
whether the two used significantly vocabular and sentence structure
during the debates. I approach this problem by creating an automated
system that analyzes transcripts and generates detailed reports about
usage of parts of speech, distinct concepts, and something called the
Windbag Index, which I used to quantify the degree of repetition in a
person's speech.

<p>The conclusion of the analysis was startling. While having
differences, Obama and McCain were much more similar to each other
than their vice-presidential counterparts, Biden and Palin. In
general, vice-presidential debates were grammatically simplier and
more repetitive.

<h2>Hive Plots</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hiveplot.com">hiveplot.com</a>

<p>Network hairball begone!

<h2>high dynamic time range photography (HDTR)</h2>

<p><a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/fun/hdtr">mkweb.bcgsc.ca/hdtr</a>

<p>This is a method of digital compositing multiple photos of the same
scene taken over a period of time. The purpose of HDTR is to generate
a final image that demonstrates the flow of time across the scene.

<h2>lumondo photography</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.lumondo.com">www.lumondo.com</a>

<p>My interest in photography has grown in to a side activity that focuses on fashion and beauty.

<h2>non-standard clock</h2>

<p><a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/fun/clock">mkweb.bcgsc.ca/fun/clock</a>

<p>What if the hands on a clock remain stationary, but the bezels move instead?
